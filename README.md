# Galaxy
Porting some old JS code that created a procedurally generated galaxy.

Fairly huge number of stars (approximately Milky Way's worth) over roughly the Milky Way's volume, but random (without structure like arms etc.).

The portion of each class of stars is about correct.

## So Far
Got it showing a single sector that maps to the miniumum window.

Next add logc to handle viewport vs. sector misalignment.




Virtualized the interface, it now loops through sectors drawing the window.

Next Up:
1. Add rotation on X axis
2. Add rotation on Y axis
3. Add rotation on Z axis
4. Support X-Z view
4. Support Y-Z view
4. Support Multiple views
5. Add perspective
6. Add > 100 Z depth
